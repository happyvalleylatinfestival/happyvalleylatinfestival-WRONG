We have invited several of the partner institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean that are currently working with academic institutions in the United States. In most cases, joint effort  is targeted to the digitization of collections in danger of disappearence due to environmental and/or political factors. The following institutions have already confirmed their attendance: 

- Institut de Sauvegarde du Patrimoine National - ISPAN (Haiti)

- Proceso de Comunidades Negras de Colombia (Colombia) 
- National Institute of Culture and History (Belize) 
- Fideicomiso Archivos Plutarco Elias Calles y Fernando Torreblanca (Mexico, D.F) 
- National Library of Jamaica - NLJ (Jamaica) 
- HeritEdge Connection - (Barbados)

We are very grateful to have two of the most important current voices of the digital humanities field for our two-day event.

Dr. Risam is an Associate Professor of Secondary and Higher Education and English at Salem State University. She also serves as the Faculty Fellow for Digital Library Initiatives, Coordinator of the Graduate Certificate in Digital Studies, and Coordinator of the Combined B.A./M.Ed. in English Education. Her research interests lie at the intersections of postcolonial and African diaspora studies, humanities knowledge infrastructures, and digital humanities. The broader goal of her research is to call attention to the inequalities and biases arisen from the rapid digital knowledge production that are reproducing the print culture, and to work collaboratively with colleagues in different disciplines to redress them.

Her first monograpg [*New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy*](http://www.roopikarisam.com/ndw) (2018) proposes a postcolonial DH approach to uncover and remediate inequalities in digital knowledge production.
